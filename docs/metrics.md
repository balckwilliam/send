# Send V2 Metrics Definitions

## Key Value Prop

Quickly and privately transfer large files from any device to any device.

## Key Business Question to Answer

Is the value proposition of a large encrypted file transfer service enough to drive Firefox Account relationships for non-Firefox users.

## Hypotheses to Test

### Primary - In support of Relationships KPI

We believe that a privacy-respecting file transfer service can drive Firefox Accounts beyond the Firefox Browser.

We will know this to be true when we see 250k Firefox Account creations from non-Firefox contexts w/in six months of launch.

### Secondary - In support of Revenue KPI

We believe that a privacy respecting service accessible beyond the reach of Firefox will provide a valuable platform to research, communicate with, and market to conscious choosers we have traditionally found hard to reach.

We will know this to be true when we can conduct six research tasks (surveys, A/B tests, fake doors, etc) in support of premium services KPIs in the first six months after launch.

## Overview of Key Measures

* Number of people using the service to send and receive files
  * Why: measure of service size. Important for understanding addressable market size
* Percent of users who have or create an FxAccount via Send
  * Why: representation of % of any service users who might be amenable to an upsell
* % of downloaders who convert into uploaders
  * Why: represents a measure of our key growth-loop potential
* Count of uploads and size
  * Why: Represents cost of service on a running basis

## Key Funnels
* App Open or Visit `--- DESIRED OUTCOME --->` Successful Upload
* Download UI Visit `--- DESIRED OUTCOME --->` Successful Download
* FxA UI Engagement `--- DESIRED OUTCOME --->` Authenticate
* **STRETCH** App Open or Visit `--- DESIRED OUTCOME --->` Successful Download
